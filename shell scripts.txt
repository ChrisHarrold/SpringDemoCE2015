Create a startspring.sh and paste these contents into it to match your path to the spring executable:

cd /spring/spring-xd-1.2.1.RELEASE/xd/bin
./xd-singlenode


This one create a startshell.sh and paste this in to start the XD shell - again make sure the path matches where you extracted the spring files:

cd /spring/spring-xd-1.2.1.RELEASE/shell/bin
./xd-shell
